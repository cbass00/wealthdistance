      <h2 class="heading">It can be incredibly difficult for the average person to imagine...
          <span>really</span> imagine the amount of money at the disposal of the ultra-rich.</h2>
        <p>The human brain is <span>terrible</span> at understanding big numbers.</p>
        <p>Sometimes changing the unit of measurement can help make sense of things.</p>
        <p>For example...</p>
      <h2 class="heading">The median household income in the United States is <span>$68,000</span> per year.</h2>
        <p>68,000 feet = 12.8 miles</p>
        <p>I'll use my hometown as a reference.</p>
        <p>That's about the distance between Bailey, NC and Wilson, NC.</p>
      <img src="distance1.png">
        <p>It takes about <span>17 minutes</span> to make that trip, going an average of 45mph.</p>
      <h2 class="heading"><p><span>1 million dollars</span> sounds like a lot of money...</p>
        <p>It's a life-changing amount of money to most people.</p></h2>
        <p>1,000,000 feet = 189 miles</p>
        <p>That's the distance between Bailey, NC and Charlotte, NC.</p>
      <img src="distance2.png">
        <p>This trip would take about 3 hours going an average of 60mph...</p>
        <p>It would take <span>4 hours</span> going an average of 45mph.</p>
      <h2 class="heading">But what about even bigger amounts of money? Like <span>1 billion dollars</span>?</h2>
        <p>If you had to guess, how far do you think 1 billion dollars would take you?</p>

<!--a multiple choice list-->

          <div class="choices">
            <div class="choices-list">
            <ul>

              <li>Around the world?</li>
              <li>To the moon?</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

        <p>The distance around the entire Earth is 24,902 miles.</p>
        <p>1 billion feet = 189,394 miles</p>
        <p>You could travel from New York City to Beijing <span>17 times</span>.</p>
        <p>You could circle the entire Earth <span>7.6 times</span>.</p>
        <p>Or you could make it <span>80% of the way to the moon</span>.</p>
      <img src="distance4.png">
        <p>At 45mph, it would take you 4,208 hours, or <span>25 weeks</span>.</p>
        <h2 class="heading"><p>Jeff Bezos is currently the richest man in the US.</p>
        <p>His wealth is estimated to be around <span>185 billion dollars</span> in 2021.</p></h2>
        <p>185 billion feet = 35,037,879 miles</p>
        <p>That's like traveling from New York City to Beijing <span>3,186 times</span>.</p>
          
        <p>Or circling the Earth <span>1,400 times</span></p>
          
        <p>It's â…“ of the distance between Earth and the Sun.</p>

        <img src="distance5.png">

        <p>There is only one Jeff Bezos...</p>
        <p>But there are <span>614 billionaires in the US</span>.</p>        
        
        <h2 class="heading">9% of households in the US make less than <span>$15,000</span> a year.</h2>
        <p>Those households could go <span>2.8 miles</span> in our money-to-distance analogy.</p>
        <p>At 45mph, it would take them <span>3 minutes and 45 seconds</span>.</p>
        <p>The federal minimum wage in 2021 is $7.25/hour.</p>
        <p>A minimum wage worker, working 40 hours a week, makes about $15,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Disabled people in America receive an average of $1,280/month in benefits as of 2021.</p>
        <p>That's $15,680/year.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">The median lifetime earnings of an American worker comes in at <span>1.7 million dollars</span>, 
          <p>or an average of $42,000 a year, at $20/hour.</p></h2>
        <p>That's <span>322 miles in 7 hours.</span></p>        

        <h2 class="heading">So to recap those numbers...</h2>

<table style="width:75%">

        <p>There's such a vast gulf between 2.8 miles and 35 million miles that it's hard to visualize.</p>
        <p>Imagine 3 minutes and 45 seconds compared to 89 years.</p>
        <p>That's higher than the life expectancy in the United States.</p>

        <h2 class="heading"><p>There is no job or career that exists that enables a single human to "earn" that kind of money.</p>
        <p><span>Money like this isn't earned - it's stolen via exploitation.</span></p></h2>
        <p>If you spent a dollar every second of every day, you would spend:</p>

<table style="width:75%">
  <tr>
    <th>Time Passed</th>
    <th>Money Spent</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1 year</td>
      <td>31.5 million</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10 years</td>
      <td>315 million</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>100 years</td>
      <td>3.1 billion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1,000 years</td>
      <td>31.5 billion</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

        <p>...and it would still take you over 5,000 years to spend all of Jeff Bezos' wealth.</p>

        <p>It probably sounds like I'm picking on Jeff Bezos, but he is far from the only person who has benefited from expoiting workers.</p>
        <p>Every minute in 2021, as the entire nation was struggling through a world wide pandemic,</p>
        <p>and many Americans were having to tighten their belts, and begging the federal government to step in and help</p>
        </p> this is how much the top companies in the US made.</p>

        <div class="corp">
          <div class="corp-list">
            <ul>
              <li><b>Amazon: <span>$840,000 revenue per minute</span></b></li>
              <li><b>Apple: <span>$700,000 per minute</span></b></li>

            </ul>

          </div>
